                    <p class="large text-muted"><b>Amber & Sage Spa</b> and <i>Natural Body</i> have an agreement in which Natural Body gift cards that meet certain qualifications are redeemable at Amber and Sage Spa. Amber and Sage Spa is not affiliated with Natural Body in any way and is a operating a completely new and independent establishment.</p>

                    <p class="large text-muted">As Natural Body decided to cease operations in Tennessee, Amber and Sage Spa agreed to honor pre-existing Natural Body gift cards in exchange for a fair equlivent of equipment, furniture, supplies, and products.</p>

                    <p class="large text-muted">This agreement was designed to be mutually benefital to Amber and Sage Spa, Natural Body, and - most importantly - the old Natural Body clients and (hopefully) new Amber and Sage Spa clients in the greater Chattanooga area.</p>

                    <p class="large text-muted">It is our goal to provide a level of service that is at least on par with Natural Body, if not better.</p>

                    <p class="large text-muted">The process to redeem the gift cards is as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="nav-item">Book a service. This can be done <a class="link-dark" href="https://booking.mangomint.com/101649">online</a> or via text message at 423-537-4221.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">In order to book a service, a credit card must be put on file and a 30% deposit made to confirm the appointment.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">After booking, you will be given the opportunity to acknowledge the "Natural Body Gift Card Form" that must be filled out prior to your appointment.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">A link to the form that must be filled out will be listed in both the text and email booking confirmations as well as the text and email booking reminders.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">Once the form is filled out and submitted, the Natural Body gift card will be "processed" by Amber and Sage Spa to be prepared for redemption.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The funds from the Natural Body gift card will be transferred to your Amber and Sage Spa Client Wallet Account Balance - this is a virtual wallet that allows your client profile to maintain a positive credit to be redeemed on future services.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">After your service, during the checkout process, any credits on your Client Wallet Account Balance will be availble to be used toward the remaining balance of the service.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">We do not have the access or ability to troubleshoot or otherwise answer any questions about the history, balance, or validity of any Natural Body gift cards. Any questions of this sort must be asked directly to Natural Body.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="large text-muted">Please note:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nav-item">Physical Natural Body gift cards must be surrendered during checkout.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">Natural Body gift cards are only redeemable on service and add-on balances and tips only, deposits and retail products can not be purchased with Natural Body gift card credit.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">Natual Body gift card balances are only redeemable during checkout if the aforementioned form is properly filled out and processed prior to the appointment. Amber and Sage Spa reserves the right to refuse a Natural Body gift card as a form of payment presented during the checkout process as the processing of the gift card is cumbersome and we do not have the bandwidth to process them in real time. <i>*This does not mean we are refusing the gift card outright, it just means you will have to book another service and fill out the form prior to that service to redeem the balance on the gift card.</i></li>
                        <li class="nav-item">Any remaining balance on the gift card is not redeemable for cash or cash equivalents.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The transfer process is a one way process. Once a balance is transferred to Amber and Sage Spa, it can not be transferred back to a Natural Body gift card.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The funds from the Natural Body gift card will be transferred to your Amber and Sage Spa Client Wallet Account Balance - this is a virtual wallet that allows your client profile to maintain a positive credit to be redeemed on future services.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">100% of the remaining Natural Body gift card balance will be transferred to your Amber and Sage Spa Client Account Wallet unless otherwise noted in the comments section of the form.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="large text-muted">Natural Body gift cards that are not valid will not be redeemed. Reasons include, but aren't limited to: </p>                    
                    <ul>
                        <li class="nav-item">The gift card does not have a balance.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The gift card is lost, stolen, or the id number is illegible.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The gift card was purchased <i>after</i> April 19th, 2025.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The gift card is expired.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The gift card can not be validated in the Natural Body system.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The transfer form was incorrectly or incompletely filled out.</li>
                        <li class="nav-item">The form was not filled out with enough time to process your gift card prior to your appointment.</li>
                    </ul>
